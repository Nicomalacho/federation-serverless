# Federation server
The Stellar [Federation](https://www.stellar.org/developers/learn/concepts/federation.html) protocol allows you to convert a human-readable address like amy*your_org.com to an account ID. It also includes information about what should be in a transactionâ€™s memo. When sending a payment, you contact a federation server first to determine what Stellar account ID to pay. Luckily, the bridge server does this for you.
